## Decision Tree

[Decision Tree.jl](Decision%20Tree.jl) is an implementation of the decision tree algorithm in Julia. This algorithm is widely used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Naive Bayes

[Naive Bayes.jl](Naive%20Bayes.jl) contains the implementation of the Naive Bayes algorithm. It is a probabilistic algorithm used for classification tasks and is particularly effective for text classification.

## Gradient Descent

[Gradient Descent.jl](Gradient%20Descent.jl) includes the implementation of the gradient descent algorithm, a fundamental optimization technique used in various machine learning algorithms.

## Linear Regression

[Linear Regression.jl](Linear%20Regression.jl) showcases the implementation of linear regression, a basic yet powerful algorithm for predicting numerical values based on input features.

## Logistic Regression

[Logistic Regression.jl](Logistic%20Regression.jl) contains the implementation of logistic regression, a commonly used algorithm for binary classification problems.

## Support Vector Networks

[Support Vector Networks.jl](Support%20Vector%20Networks.jl) includes the implementation of support vector machines, a versatile algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks.
